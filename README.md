â—† If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design.

ANSWERS:

*If this is going to be deployed to production, the next step I would take would be to further improve the UI, for the CRUD to use pop-up modals instead of different web pages.

*I would also make the salary editable so that it is not fixed to 20000 or 500, also including hourly rate is good for a much more detailed process.

*Editable tax field in order to accomodate new possible new employee types

*Inclusion of yearly computation of salary so that other factors such as 13th month pay can be considered, and a payroll system can be created.

SETUP: Make sure to restore the database included in this repository (SproutExam_PerezDB) since it has the stored procedures for the Crud
